# Changelog

All notable changes to `skill-basketball-streams` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`SKILL.md` — `> IMPORTANT MAGENTA NOTE` blockquote** under `## Approved Sources` — explains the two-domain split: `magentasport.de` (content/announcement provider) vs `magenta.tv` (streaming platform), dynamic URL problem, and the mandatory both-domain check requirement.
- **`SKILL.md` — `### Step 2.3 — MagentaSport/MagentaTV Special Handling`** — new sub-step inserted between Step 2 and Step 2.5 with: domain separation, mandatory two-step announcement + stream search strategy, free stream indicators (PASS), paid indicators (FAIL → REJECT), and cross-reference rule (no announcement = REJECT).
- **`SKILL.md` — Constraint #11** — `Magenta two-domain rule`: a `magenta.tv` stream URL requires a matching official free-access announcement on `magentasport.de` or MagentaSport social media; without it → REJECT.
- **`SKILL.md` — Rationalizations row** — `"The magenta.tv URL looks valid so no announcement needed"` → why it's wrong.
- **`SKILL.md` — two new Red Flag checklist items** — (1) used `magenta.tv` stream URL without finding a matching free-access announcement on `magentasport.de`; (2) searched only one Magenta domain and skipped the other.
- **`references/validation-workflow.md` — expanded MagentaSport/MagentaTV Special Case** — replaced the thin 3-bullet `### MagentaSport Free Game` section with a full `### MagentaSport/MagentaTV Special Case` covering: domain separation, free stream policy (one game per matchday), mandatory two-step search strategy, free stream indicators (PASS), subscription/paid indicators (FAIL), and a Validation Note for Check 1 (HTTP 200 alone is insufficient without a matching announcement).

### Changed

- **`SKILL.md` version** bumped from `1.1.1` to `1.1.2`.
- **`SKILL.md` References section** — updated `references/validation-workflow.md` description to mention `MagentaSport two-domain rule + 1-game rule`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (NEW at repo root) — top-level contributor doc with quick-start, eval-case schema (required vs recommended fields), release-workflow pointer, broken-link issue format, and a Conventional Commits prefix note.
- **`scripts/README.md` → Releasing`** — canonical release workflow section covering pre-v1.1.0 (legacy GH013 + admin-bypass) vs post-v1.1.0 (direct push) flows, the `gh pr merge --rebase --admin` command, the tag + tag-push step, and the `delete_branch_on_merge` note.
- **`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`** (NEW) — CodeQL analysis on every push + PR + weekly cron (`0 6 * * 1`) on the default branch. Security-extended query suite over Python, SARIF upload via `github/codeql-action/analyze@v3`. Augments the validator matrix with security scanning.
- **`.gitignore`** — created with `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`, and `.pytest_cache/` patterns. pytest bytecode cache is no longer tracked.

### Changed

- **Ruleset 18142708 (`Main`)** — removed the `code_scanning` rule. CodeQL default-setup was `not-configured`; the rule was checking against absent results. Direct `git push origin main` now succeeds for any contributor with admin role. Other rules (`deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `required_linear_history`, `code_quality`) preserved.
- **Repo setting `delete_branch_on_merge: true`** — feat branches auto-cleanup after a successful PR merge (was `false`).
- **`scripts/validate.py:smoke_test`** — driven by `CHECKS.keys()` iteration over a per-check `fail_fixtures` registry. Adding a 4th check now produces a typed error ("no FAIL-fixture builder registered") if its fixture is not also registered.
- **`tests/test_validate.py`** — added `@pytest.mark.parametrize`-decorated `test_each_check_fail_branch_via_parametrize` for the 3 CHECKS entries, plus module-level `_setup_*_fail` helpers. Adding a 4th check requires one tuple entry.

### Cleanup

- **`feat/test-suite-and-eval-expansion`** branch REFERENCE — deleted locally + on remote after PR #1 (v1.1.0 release) merged at commit `21e7bcc`. The merged commits themselves remain on `main` (post-rebase at `21e7bcc`); only the branch ref is gone. `git log main` still shows the contribution.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Test suite (`tests/`)** — pytest suite covering both `scripts/validate.py` (per-check PASS + targeted FAIL branches via tmp fixtures + CLI / USAGE contracts) and `scripts/runtime_eval.py` (structural pass + runtime pass + `.strip()` normalization + non-string stub rejection + missing-stub detection + malformed JSON + non-coercible int keys). Run with `pytest tests/` from the project root. Stdlib-only except for `pytest` itself; see `requirements-dev.txt`.
- **`requirements-dev.txt`** — declares `pytest>=8.0` as the only test dependency (lower bound keeps Python 3.8 supported in the CI matrix — pytest 9 dropped 3.8). Production scripts remain stdlib-only on Python 3.8+.
- **`tests/pytest.ini`** — pytest configuration (testpaths, default options, warning filter).
- **CI step: pytest** — `.github/workflows/validate.yml` now installs `requirements-dev.txt` and runs `pytest tests/` per matrix entry, so the full unit-test suite runs alongside the validator + smoke-test + runtime_eval on every push/PR (5 Python versions × `fail-fast: false`).
- **CI step: runtime_eval structural pass** — `.github/workflows/validate.yml` now runs `python3 scripts/runtime_eval.py --root .` as an additional step, so the per-case structural coverage runs alongside the validator on every push/PR.
- **CI Python matrix** — `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs the validator + smoke-test + runtime_eval + pytest over `python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']` so every documented stdlib compatibility range is covered.
- **Eval cases 9–12** — `evals/evals.json` extended from 8 to 12 standard-schema cases. New coverage: positive (BBL club website on `albaberlin.de` passes all 7 checks; Dyn Sport Mix free tier via Pluto TV) and negative (past event violates Check 5; future event >+7d violates Check 5).
- **`scripts/runtime_eval.py`** — stdlib-only scaffold runtime-evaluator with two modes — **structural pass** (`--root .` walks every case and asserts `id:int` + `expected_output:str` + `assertions:list`) and **runtime pass** (`--stubs stubs.json` asserts each stub string equals the case's `expected_output` AND every evaluation-assertion needle parses out of the corpus).
- **`scripts/README.md`** — maintenance doc covering: which scripts exist, how to add a new check, how to add a new eval case (JSON-aware heredoc edits), how to update `runtime_eval.py`, exit codes + CLI conventions, and CI integration.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Keep-a-Changelog format with `[Unreleased]` and dated release sections.

### Changed

- **`check_evals` type-coverage** — extended with per-case type assertions: `isinstance(expected_output, str)` and `isinstance(assertions[i], str)` per entry. Loose by design: empty strings / empty lists / whitespace remain legitimate (a case can carry "no PASS/FAIL signal" via `assertions: []` or "no output" via `expected_output: ""`). Catches type-shape regressions like `expected_output: 42` without rejecting legitimately-empty cases.
- **`scripts/validate.py --check evals` exit code** — moved from exit 1 on first failure to "print all failures, then exit 1" so a single run surfaces every regression in one go instead of forcing an edit-fail-fix loop.
- **Eval case assertions populated** — cases id=3, id=7, id=8 (which had `assertions: []` after the initial `expected.checks` migration) now carry a single `officialSource expected PASS|FAIL` assertion derived from each case's prompt + expected_output, with matching `; checks: officialSource=...` tokens appended so the assertion needle parses out of the corpus.

### Fixed

- **Format consistency for case id=3 / id=7 / id=8 expected_output** — replaced the double-semicolon + empty `checks:` field produced by the initial assertion-population edit with the comma-separated token pattern used by cases id=1, 2, 4, 5, 6.

- `scripts/validate.py` — stdlib-only validator running `check_evals` (v1.0.0 schema), `check_skill` (frontmatter + body ≤250 lines + mandatory sections), `check_references` (backtick-wrapped `.md` path resolution), plus `--check smoke-test` regression guard with three target-fixture subprocess invocations.
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — initial CI with concurrency group, cancel-in-progress, 5-min timeout.
- `README.md` — overview + Mermaid dataflow + self-validation checklist.
